**Story ID:** EPIC-01-001  
**Epic:** [EPIC-01: Logging Ingestion & Transport](../epic-01.md)  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High

## User Story

As a **developer**, I want a **well-designed ingestion API** so that **I can send logs from my applications reliably and securely**.

## Description

Design and specify the HTTP/gRPC ingestion API with proper authentication, rate limiting, and error handling.

## Tasks

- [ ] Define API endpoints and methods (POST /logs, health checks)
- [ ] Design request/response schemas (JSON payloads, error formats)
- [ ] Specify authentication methods (API keys, JWT, mTLS)
- [ ] Define rate limiting strategies (per-user, per-service limits)
- [ ] Document API specification (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Plan error handling and status codes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] API specification is documented and reviewed
- [ ] Authentication mechanism is defined and secure
- [ ] Rate limiting strategy prevents abuse
- [ ] Error responses are consistent and helpful
- [ ] API supports both structured (JSON) and plain text logs

## Definition of Done

- [ ] OpenAPI specification completed
- [ ] Security review passed
- [ ] Architecture review approved
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and accepted
