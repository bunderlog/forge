# Story: Implement Ingestion API Server (5 points)

**Story ID:** EPIC-01-002  
**Epic:** [EPIC-01: Logging Ingestion & Transport](../epic-01.md)  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High

## User Story

As a **system administrator**, I want a **robust ingestion server** so that **logs can be received and processed reliably at scale**.

## Description

Implement the HTTP/gRPC server that receives log entries, validates them, and forwards them to the transport layer.

## Tasks

- [ ] Set up Go HTTP/gRPC server framework
- [ ] Implement log ingestion endpoints
- [ ] Add request validation and sanitization
- [ ] Implement authentication middleware
- [ ] Add rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints
- [ ] Add request/response logging
- [ ] Create configuration management

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Server accepts HTTP POST requests with log payloads
- [ ] Authentication is required and working
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse
- [ ] Invalid requests return appropriate error codes
- [ ] Server handles concurrent requests efficiently
- [ ] Health checks report server status accurately

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented and tested
- [ ] Unit tests pass (>80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Performance tests show acceptable throughput
- [ ] Security tests pass
- [ ] Code review completed
