# Story: Build Query API Endpoints (5 points)

**Story ID:** EPIC-03-001  
**Epic:** [EPIC-03: Query API & Filtering](../epic-03.md)  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High

## User Story

As a **frontend developer**, I want **RESTful query API endpoints** so that **I can build search interfaces for log data**.

## Description

Implement REST API endpoints that allow querying log data with various filters, pagination, and basic aggregations.

## Tasks

- [ ] Design REST API endpoints (/api/logs/search, /api/logs/aggregate)
- [ ] Implement query parameter parsing (time range, filters, pagination)
- [ ] Create query builder for storage backend
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Implement pagination with cursor support
- [ ] Add basic aggregations (count, group by level/service)
- [ ] Create API documentation (OpenAPI)
- [ ] Add query performance optimization

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] API supports time range queries
- [ ] Filtering works for service, level, and text search
- [ ] Pagination handles large result sets efficiently
- [ ] Aggregation queries return in < 2 seconds
- [ ] API responses are consistent and well-structured
- [ ] Query performance meets SLA requirements (median < 500ms)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] API endpoints implemented and tested
- [ ] Unit and integration tests pass
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation is complete
- [ ] Performance tests show acceptable response times
- [ ] Security review passed
- [ ] Load testing completed
