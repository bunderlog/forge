# Story: Implement Query Language Parser (3 points)

**Story ID:** EPIC-03-002  
**Epic:** [EPIC-03: Query API & Filtering](../epic-03.md)  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** Medium

## User Story

As a **power user**, I want a **query language** so that **I can write complex search queries with advanced filtering logic**.

## Description

Implement a query language parser that allows users to write complex search queries with AND/OR logic, field-specific searches, and advanced operators.

## Tasks

- [ ] Design query language syntax (similar to Lucene or KQL)
- [ ] Implement query parser with lexer/tokenizer
- [ ] Add support for field-specific queries (service:api-gateway)
- [ ] Implement logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- [ ] Add range queries for timestamps and numeric fields
- [ ] Create query validation and error reporting
- [ ] Add query autocompletion support
- [ ] Write query language documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can write field-specific queries
- [ ] Logical operators work correctly with precedence
- [ ] Range queries work for dates and numbers
- [ ] Invalid queries show helpful error messages
- [ ] Query parser handles edge cases gracefully
- [ ] Documentation includes examples and syntax guide

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Query parser implemented and tested
- [ ] Unit tests pass (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests with API endpoints pass
- [ ] Query language documentation completed
- [ ] Performance tests show acceptable parsing speed
- [ ] Code review approved
