# Epic 5: Observability & Monitoring (8 points)

**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Epic ID:** EPIC-05

## Description

Provide telemetry for the logging platform itselfâ€”ingestion rates, error rates, pipeline latency, and storage metrics.

## Key Tasks

- Instrument ingestion and indexing pipelines with metrics (counts, latencies, errors)
- Expose metrics endpoints and dashboards (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Add alerting for high error rates, backlog growth, or storage issues

## Acceptance Criteria

- Dashboards show key operational metrics
- Alerts trigger when defined thresholds are crossed in test scenarios

## Dependencies

- [Epic 1: Logging Ingestion & Transport](epic-01.md) - Needs instrumented components
- [Epic 2: Storage & Indexing](epic-02.md) - Storage metrics
