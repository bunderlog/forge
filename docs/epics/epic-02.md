**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Epic ID:** EPIC-02

## Description

Provide efficient, cost-conscious storage and an indexing layer to support search and retention policies.

## Key Tasks

- Choose storage backend (Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, ClickHouse, or object+index approach)
- Implement indexing pipeline for searchable fields (timestamp, service, level, trace id)
- Implement configurable retention (hot/warm/cold tiers)
- Provide bulk ingestion and compaction strategies

## Acceptance Criteria

- Logs are queryable by indexed fields and time range
- Retention rules drop or archive logs per policy
- Storage metrics and cost estimates are documented and validated via small-scale test
