# Epic 1: Logging Ingestion & Transport (13 points)

**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High  
**Epic ID:** EPIC-01

## Description

Build the backend pipeline for receiving logs from services, normalizing payloads, and reliably transporting them into storage.

## Key Tasks

- Design ingestion API (HTTP/gRPC) with authentication and rate limiting
- Implement agents/SDKs for common platforms (Go, Node.js) to ship logs
- Add batching, retry, and backpressure handling
- Support structured (JSON) and plain-text logs
- Implement transport to the chosen storage (e.g., object store, time-series DB, or log index)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Ingestion API accepts test payloads and returns appropriate status codes
- SDKs can send logs that appear in downstream storage within expected latency
- System recovers from transient failures without data loss (verified via load test)

## Dependencies

- None (foundational epic)
