# Story: Implement Indexing Pipeline (5 points)

**Story ID:** EPIC-02-002  
**Epic:** [EPIC-02: Storage & Indexing](../epic-02.md)  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High

## User Story

As a **developer**, I want an **indexing pipeline** so that **logs can be searched efficiently by key fields**.

## Description

Build the pipeline that processes incoming logs and indexes them for fast searching on key fields like timestamp, service name, log level, and trace ID.

## Tasks

- [ ] Design indexing schema for log fields
- [ ] Implement log parsing and field extraction
- [ ] Create indexing workers/processors
- [ ] Add error handling for malformed logs
- [ ] Implement batch processing for efficiency
- [ ] Add monitoring and metrics for indexing pipeline
- [ ] Create index management (creation, rotation)
- [ ] Test indexing performance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Logs are indexed within acceptable latency (< 30 seconds)
- [ ] Key fields (timestamp, service, level, trace_id) are searchable
- [ ] Malformed logs are handled gracefully
- [ ] Indexing pipeline scales with log volume
- [ ] Index performance meets query requirements
- [ ] Pipeline recovers from failures automatically

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Indexing pipeline implemented and tested
- [ ] Performance tests show acceptable throughput
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards are available
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] Code review passed
