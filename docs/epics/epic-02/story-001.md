**Story ID:** EPIC-02-001  
**Epic:** [EPIC-02: Storage & Indexing](../epic-02.md)  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** High

## User Story

As a **system architect**, I want to **evaluate and choose a storage backend** so that **we have an optimal solution for log storage and querying**.

## Description

Research, evaluate, and choose the storage backend for log data, considering cost, performance, scalability, and operational requirements.

## Tasks

- [ ] Research storage options (Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, ClickHouse, object storage)
- [ ] Create evaluation criteria (cost, performance, scalability, operations)
- [ ] Run proof-of-concept tests with sample data
- [ ] Document trade-offs and recommendations
- [ ] Set up development environment with chosen solution
- [ ] Create infrastructure-as-code templates

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Storage solution is chosen based on documented criteria
- [ ] Development environment is running and accessible
- [ ] Basic read/write operations work
- [ ] Infrastructure can be reproduced via code
- [ ] Team is trained on chosen technology

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Technology decision document completed
- [ ] Development environment is operational
- [ ] Infrastructure code is committed
- [ ] Team knowledge transfer completed
- [ ] Architecture review approved
