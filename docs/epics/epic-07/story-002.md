**Epic:** EPIC-07: DevOps & Deployment  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Priority:** High

## User Story

As a **platform engineer**  
I want **containerized deployment with orchestration**  
So that **applications can scale efficiently and recover from failures**

## Tasks

- [ ] Create Docker containers for all application components
- [ ] Set up Kubernetes cluster configuration
- [ ] Implement container health checks and readiness probes
- [ ] Configure horizontal pod autoscaling
- [ ] Set up service mesh for inter-service communication
- [ ] Create monitoring and logging for container infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All services are containerized with optimized images
- [ ] Kubernetes cluster is configured and operational
- [ ] Health checks ensure unhealthy containers are restarted
- [ ] Autoscaling responds appropriately to load changes
- [ ] Service mesh provides secure and monitored communication
- [ ] Container metrics and logs are collected and accessible

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Docker images built and tested
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests created and applied
- [ ] Health checks configured and validated
- [ ] Autoscaling tested under load
- [ ] Service mesh deployed and configured
- [ ] Container monitoring operational
- [ ] Deployment documentation updated
