**Epic:** EPIC-09: Testing & Quality  
**Story Points:** 2  
**Priority:** Medium

## User Story

As a **performance engineer**  
I want **load testing and performance validation**  
So that **I can ensure the system handles expected traffic volumes**

## Tasks

- [ ] Create load testing scenarios for typical usage patterns
- [ ] Implement stress testing for peak load conditions
- [ ] Set up performance benchmarking and regression testing
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring during tests
- [ ] Create automated performance validation in CI
- [ ] Document performance requirements and SLAs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Load tests simulate realistic user traffic patterns
- [ ] Stress tests validate system behavior under peak load
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are established and tracked
- [ ] Performance monitoring identifies bottlenecks during testing
- [ ] Automated performance tests prevent regressions
- [ ] Performance SLAs are documented and validated

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Load testing framework configured
- [ ] Test scenarios implemented and validated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Monitoring integration completed
- [ ] CI performance gates implemented
- [ ] Performance requirements documented
- [ ] Load testing procedures created
