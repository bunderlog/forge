# Story: Implement System Metrics Collection (3 points)

**Story ID:** EPIC-05-001  
**Epic:** [EPIC-05: Observability & Monitoring](../epic-05.md)  
**Status:** Not Started  
**Priority:** Medium

## User Story

As a **platform engineer**, I want **system metrics collection** so that **I can monitor the health and performance of the logging platform**.

## Description

Instrument the logging platform components with metrics collection for ingestion rates, processing latency, storage utilization, and error rates.

## Tasks

- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics to ingestion API
- [ ] Instrument indexing pipeline with performance metrics
- [ ] Add storage utilization and performance metrics
- [ ] Implement custom business metrics (logs/sec, services)
- [ ] Create metrics exposition endpoints
- [ ] Add health check endpoints with detailed status
- [ ] Configure metrics collection intervals
- [ ] Document all available metrics

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Key system metrics are collected and exposed
- [ ] Metrics include ingestion rate, latency, and errors
- [ ] Storage metrics show utilization and performance
- [ ] Health checks provide detailed component status
- [ ] Metrics are properly labeled and categorized
- [ ] Collection has minimal performance impact

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Metrics collection implemented across all components
- [ ] Prometheus metrics endpoint working
- [ ] Health checks provide accurate status
- [ ] Performance impact testing completed
- [ ] Metrics documentation completed
- [ ] Integration with monitoring stack tested
