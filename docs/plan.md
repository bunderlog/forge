# Centralized Logging System - Project Plan

This document provides an overview of the centralized logging system project, including epic organization and development phases.

## Project Overview

Building a centralized logging system with an associated website implementation for viewing and managing logs. The system will provide log ingestion, storage, querying, and a user-friendly web interface.

## Epic Organization

All detailed epics have been extracted to individual files in the [`epics/`](epics/) directory for better organization and tracking.

**Quick Links:**

- [MVP Epics](epics/README.md#mvp-minimum-viable-product) - Essential features for initial launch

## Development Approach

**Story Point Scale:** Fibonacci-like scale (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20)
**Team Assumption:** Small cross-functional team (frontend, backend, devops)
**Sprint Cadence:** 2-week sprints

**Total Project Size:** 89 story points across 10 epics

## Phase Planning

### Phase 1: MVP (52 points, ~6-8 sprints)

Core functionality for a working logging system:

- [EPIC-01: Logging Ingestion & Transport](epics/epic-01.md) (13 pts)
- [EPIC-02: Storage & Indexing](epics/epic-02.md) (13 pts)
- [EPIC-03: Query API & Filtering](epics/epic-03.md) (8 pts)
- [EPIC-04: Website & UX](epics/epic-04.md) (13 pts)
- [EPIC-09: Onboarding & Documentation](epics/epic-09.md) (5 pts)

### Phase 2: Production Hardening (29 points, ~4-5 sprints)

Operational readiness and security:

- [EPIC-05: Observability & Monitoring](epics/epic-05.md) (8 pts)
- [EPIC-06: Security, Privacy & Compliance](epics/epic-06.md) (8 pts)
- [EPIC-07: Scaling, HA & Disaster Recovery](epics/epic-07.md) (13 pts)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (8 points, ~1-2 sprints)

Enhanced capabilities and marketing:

- [EPIC-08: Alerts & Integrations](epics/epic-08.md) (5 pts)
- [EPIC-10: Website Publishing & Marketing](epics/epic-10.md) (3 pts)

## Next Steps

1. **Epic Review**: Review individual epics in [`epics/`](epics/) directory with stakeholders
2. **Story Breakdown**: Break selected epics into sprint-ready stories with detailed tasks
3. **Technical Planning**: Choose specific technologies for storage backend, web framework, etc.
4. **Team Formation**: Assemble cross-functional team with frontend, backend, and DevOps skills
5. **Infrastructure Setup**: Establish development and testing environments
